This directory holds the babel.org file, which is a plain text
Org-mode document introducing the use of Org-mode for reproducible
research.  The following instructions can be used to generate a
viewable pdf version of this document.  The generation process
involves evaluating the source code blocks embedded in babel.org,
performing the relevant calculations, and generating the referenced
figures.

1. Install the latest version of emacs (24.0.50.2 or greater) from
   source with
   :  bzr branch --stacked bzr://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/emacs/trunk emacs

2. Ensure that no old versions of Org-mode exist in your Emacs load
   path (e.g., =/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp=).

3. Ensure that the following executables are installed on your system
   and in your $PATH.  Run "make check" to print the names of all
   missing dependencies.
   - curl
   - dot
   - perl
   - python
   - R (including the RSQLite package)
   - sh
   - sqlite
     - the executable should be named "sqlite3", if not then
       customize the value of `org-babel-sqlite3-command'

4. Install the "RSQlite" R library with
   #+begin_src R
     install.packages('RSQlite')
   #+end_src

5. Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) provides support for communication
   between Emacs and a persistent R process. To install ESS download
   the source code from http://ess.r-project.org/ -- this paper was
   tested with version 5.13.  Unpack the download into a directory on
   your machine, and update the `ess-path' variable on the second line
   of init.el in this directory to point to your local ess/lisp/
   directory.

6. Alternatively, follow steps 7 through 10 below for interactive
   compilation or simply call =make= from within this directory.

7. From the command line, cd into the directory that holds babel.org
   and then launch Emacs using the following command.
   : emacs -Q -l init.el babel.org

8. The resulting Emacs window will be visiting the Org-mode file,
   babel.org.  From here it is possible to navigate and edit the
   document, and to inspect and evaluate source code blocks.

9. Export the document to LaTeX with the M-x org-export-as-latex
   command---just press RET in reply to queries from R.

10. The resulting babel.tex file can be built from the command line
    with pdflatex and bibtex.

Note: Some of the code blocks in babel.org are commented out for
  purposes of demonstrating Org-mode syntax and are thus not evaluated
  during export.  When this is the case an interactively executable
  but non-exporting version of the code block is included in-line.
