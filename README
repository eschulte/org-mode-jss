This directory holds the babel.org file, which is a plain text
Org-mode document introducing the use of Org-mode for reproducible
research.  The following instructions can be used to generate a
viewable pdf version of this document evaluating the embedded code
blocks, performing the relevant calculations and generating the
referenced figures.

1. Install the latest version of emacs "Emacs 24" from
   http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs

2. Ensure that the following executables are installed on your system
   and in your $PATH
   - curl
   - dot
   - haskell
   - perl
   - python
   - R
   - ruby
   - sh
   - sqlite

3. Install the "RSQlite" R library

4. Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) provides support for communication
   between Emacs and a persistent R process. To install ESS download
   the source code from http://ess.r-project.org/ -- this paper was
   tested with version 5.13.  Unpack the download into a directory on
   your machine, and update the `ess-path' variable on the second line
   of init.el in this directory to point to the ess/lisp/ directory.

5. From the command line, cd into this directory and then launch Emacs
   using the following command
   
   : emacs -Q -l init.el babel.org

6. The resulting Emacs window will be visiting the babel.org Org-mode
   file.  From here it is possible to navigate the document within
   Org-mode inspecting and interactively evaluating code examples.
   Export the document to LaTeX with the M-x org-export-as-latex
   command---just press RET if prompted by R about saving data files.

7. The resulting babel.tex file can be build normally using the
   pdflatex command.  Alternatively once all requirements have been
   included these last two steps can be performed by simply calling
   make within this directory.
