For authors of JSS705 (rev 1)

The README file is now clear on what needs to be done. After building
bzr and the latest emacs, I am now able to build the document and try
some examples of my own. I had only minor difficulty in that my LaTeX
installation does not have the attrib package. The article is clearly
written and now gives better guidance on where to get more
information. This is obviously very useful and powerful stuff, and
while I still have a big learning curve ahead, it is likely that I
will be using this in my own work.

A few comments...

1. Table 1 and associated text
Table 1 omits StatWeave, though the text cites it. StatWeave is a
language-agnostic extension of Sweave, in that any language can be
tangled and it supports many languages (and can be extended to more
via additional Java classes). It seems that StatWeave should be added
to Table 1.

2. Section 3, line 3 "... currently at version 23."
Maybe I continue to misunderstand this, but I think this is
misleading. I had to build version 24 of emacs in order to get this
software to work -- and that's also what the README file that
accompanies the source files says.

3. Page 8, the TODO example:
A stray \texttt{...} appears there. I believe this is a bug.

4. Page 9, Evaluation subsection
I would have expected this to evaluate to today's actual date rather
than last December. Obviously, this part of the document was not
rebuilt when I ran the 'make' operation, whereas I can tell than some
other parts were. I think maybe you need to be clearer (say in the
README file) on which parts are which.
